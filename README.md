# Code Generation with LSTM and NLP

This program uses a combination of LSTM and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate code snippets from a given set of code examples and high-level task descriptions.

# Overview
The program has three main sections:

- In the first section, the program connects to a database and retrieves a set of correct and incorrect code examples. The examples are then modified using mutation or crossover techniques. The program also retrieves a set of test cases and defines a set of tests or uses an existing test suite to evaluate the generated code.

- In the second section, the program prepares the data for an LSTM model by tokenizing the code examples and splitting them into input-output pairs. The program then trains the LSTM model on the prepared data using backpropagation and a suitable optimizer and loss function. The program also explores the hyperparameter space using a Bayesian optimization algorithm to find the optimal set of hyperparameters that minimize the error on a validation set.

- In the third section, the program defines a function to generate code from a high-level task description. The program also prompts the user to input a task description, generates a high-level description using NLP techniques, and generates code from the high-level description using the function defined in the third section.

# Technical Details

Section 1
- The program connects to a MySQL database using the mysql-connector-python library and retrieves the correct and incorrect code examples using a SQL query. The program modifies the code examples using mutation or crossover techniques by randomly selecting a mutation or crossover operation for each example. The program then evaluates the generated code using a set of test cases and a set of tests defined in the main_definitions.py file.

Section 2
- The program prepares the data for an LSTM model by tokenizing the code examples using the tokenize module in the Python standard library. The program then splits the tokenized code examples into input-output pairs and converts the pairs into numerical format using a one-hot encoding technique. The program also splits the data into training and validation sets and defines a suitable loss function and optimizer for the LSTM model. The program then trains the LSTM model using backpropagation and the fit() method in Keras.

- To explore the hyperparameter space, the program uses a Bayesian optimization algorithm implemented in the bayes_opt library. The algorithm selects hyperparameters such as the number of LSTM units, the learning rate, and the batch size, and evaluates their performance on a validation set. The algorithm then updates the hyperparameters based on the evaluation results and continues the search until the optimal set of hyperparameters is found.

Section 3
- The program defines a function generate_code_from_description() that generates code from a high-level task description using NLP techniques. The function uses the spaCy library to parse the description and extract relevant information such as program type, variable names, variable types, and operations. The function then generates code based on the parsed information.

- The program prompts the user to input a task description and generates a high-level description using NLP techniques. The program then generates code from the high-level description using the generate_code_from_description() function defined in the third section.

# Conclusion
The program uses a combination of LSTM and NLP techniques to generate code snippets from a given set of code examples and high-level task descriptions. The program demonstrates how machine learning and NLP techniques can be used to automate the process of generating code and improve developer productivity. The program can be further improved by using more advanced machine learning and NLP techniques and by integrating with existing code generation tools and workflows.
